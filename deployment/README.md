### Why Deployment if we have opportunity of pod?
**Rolling Updates and Rollbacks:**

Deployment allow you to update your application without downtime. You can also rollback to a previous deployment if something goes wrong.

**Replica Sets:**

Deployments create Replica Sets which are used to ensure that a specified number of pod replicas are running at any given time.

**Scaling:**

Deployments allow you to scale your application up or down.
