**ClusterIP:**

The ClusterIP Service is used for Pod-to-Pod communication within the same cluster. 

This means that a client running outside of the cluster, such as a user accessing an application over the internet, cannot directly access a ClusterIP Service.


**NodePort:**

The NodePort Service provides a way to expose your application to external clients. 

An external client is anyone who is trying to access your application from outside of the Kubernetes cluster.
